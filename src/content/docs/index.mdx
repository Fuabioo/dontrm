## Why?

It is often said that Linux gives you the power to do ANYTHING you want.
That is quite literally true. You might think that the `rm` command prevents you to remove
the system root, which is more or less true.
Even if you cancel the command 0.5 seconds after it began it is already too late.

This tool will help you prevent you from f****ng yourself.
[As I have done many times in the past](https://github.com/Fuabioo/dontrm/blob/main/main.go#L147).

Here are some examples:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **THESE WILL DESTROY YOUR SYSTEM!!!**

##### Base example everyone knows

`rm` won't let you just remove the root unless you provide the `--no-preserve-root` flag e.g.

export const exampleCode1 = `sudo rm -fr --no-preserve-root /`;
export const fileName1 = 'malicious-shell-script.sh';
export const highlights = ['--no-preserve-root'];

<Code code={exampleCode1} lang="sh" title={fileName1} mark={highlights} />

##### Glob patterns

However, you might not know that `/*` actually resolves differently.
It resolves in all the contents using a glob pattern and thus it won't be
protected by the lack of `--no-preserve-root` flag.

export const exampleCode2 = `sudo rm -fr /*`;
export const fileName2 = 'super-duper-malicious-shell-script.sh';

<Code code={exampleCode2} lang="sh" title={fileName2} mark={highlights} />

##### Victim of `sudo`

Depending on what you have done recently in your shell session, you don't
even need to provide `sudo` e.g.

export const exampleCode3 = `
sudo echo 'henlo fren'
rm -fr /*`;
export const fileName3 = 'hyper-malicious-shell-script.sh';

<Code code={exampleCode3} lang="sh" title={fileName3} mark={highlights} />

## Installation

### Linux apt

> Requires [apt repository](https://apt.fuabioo.com) to be registered

```sh
sudo apt install dontrm
```

### Using installation script

<Steps>

1. Execute the installation script. By default should install to `/usr/bin`

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://fuabioo.github.io/dontrm/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. Verify your installation.

   ```sh
   dontrm version
   ```

3. (Optional) Replace `rm` with `dontrm` in your shell configuration (e.g. `.bashrc` `.zshrc`).
  This can be done by either an alias (for humans using terminal)
  or a function (if you want scripts to also be affected by this).

   ```sh
   alias rm="dontrm"
   ```

   ```sh
   rm() {
       dontrm $@
   }
   ```

   ```sh
   rm version
   ```

</Steps>

## Disclaimer

This is only a `rm` wrapper, under the hood it only validates the input to prevent any
accidental removal that would normally pass without trouble on `rm`.
The only difference added to the CLI is that a new `version` command was added to:

- Give visibility of what version you have installed (obviously)
- If you have the alias, to give you the means to verify it as well
